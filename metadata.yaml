description: "The Lost Princess of Oz is the eleventh canonical Oz book written by\
  \ L. Frank Baum. Published on June 5, 1917, it begins with the disappearance of\
  \ Princess Ozma, the ruler of Oz and covers Dorothy and the Wizard's efforts to\
  \ find her. The introduction to the book states that its inspiration was a letter\
  \ a little girl had written to Baum: \"I suppose if Ozma ever got hurt or losted,\
  \ everybody would be sorry.\"\nThe book was dedicated to the author's newborn granddaughter\
  \ Ozma Baum, child of his youngest son Kenneth Gage Baum.\nRuth Plumly Thompson\
  \ borrowed the plot of this novel for her 1937 Oz book Handy Mandy in Oz. The Frogman\
  \ and Cayke's dishpan re-appear in Jeff Freedman's 1994 novel The Magic Dishpan\
  \ of Oz.\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA)."
